ALGORITHM
Number of gallons runoff =length_of_root * width_of_root * amt_of_rain /231

INPUTS
legnth_of_roof (feet)
width_of_roof (feet)
amt_of rain (inches)

OUTPUTS
runoff_in_gallons (gallons)

PROCESSING STEPS
runoff_in_cu_inches = (legnth_of_roof *12) * (width_of_roof  * 12) * (amt_of rain)
runoff_in_gallons = runoff_in_cu_inches/231

(50*12 * 20*12 * 1)/231 Inch = 623.38
